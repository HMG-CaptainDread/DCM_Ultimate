			<defName>TMM_GoldFern</defName>
			<label>Gold Fern</label>
			<description>Gold ferns are an unusual herb which draw nutrients from the soil and, via chemical process, convert them into a molecular structure indistinguishable from gold. Engineered on Glitterworlds, the exact process is not easily understood. What is understood is that the mature fronds are effectively made of gold, and at that point the "how" kind of ceases to matter.</description>

	<!-- PLASTEEL BULB -->

			<defName>TMM_PlasteelBulb</defName>
			<label>Plasteel Bulb</label>
			<description>Plasteel bulbs are soft gelatinous blobs which draw unrefined plasteel compounds from the environment around them into their form. As they mature they slowly harden as the plasteel takes up a higher percentage of their body. Surprisingly, they aren't actually a plant at all, but a small, immobile and utterly helpless critter. The harvested body that may be refined is their skeleton, which in actuality is nothing more than a lifeless husk. Seeds for more plasteel bulbs are always found within this husk, meaning this lifeform is reliant upon the refinement process to reproduce.</description>

			<label>Silver Flower</label>
			<description>Many planets have grown to utilise silver as their accepted currency, means to obtain more quickly became among the most pressing of matters on those planets. The most advanced worlds lead this search, several of which became prominent Glitterworlds after the invention of this beautiful flower. Razor sharp silver petals radiate from a thorny stem. Growing these requires care and attention, however it is the harvest that is by far the most difficult stage.</description>

	<!-- STEEL SHROOM TREE -->

			<defName>TMM_Steelshroom</defName>
			<label>Steelshroom</label>
			<description>There have always been fungi that have had a remarkable ability to draw minerals from the ground in which it grows, the steelshroom, however, takes this to an extreme. Over time, this fungal mass produces toadstool like growths, the waste byproduct of the fungi consuming mass amounts of iron for energy. Created on Urbworlds to help meet their ever growing need for steel by fugitive Glitterworld scientists, in rare cases they have run wild, eventually overrunning planets. Without sufficient metal readily accessible this is not a threat.</description>

			<label>Uranium Root</label>
			<description>All things are subject to radiation, and, once irradiated, tend to radiate it outwards as the material works out its half-life. As with most things, the Uranium Root plant absorbs radiation, however, unlike most things, the root has a unique way of dealing with it. The plant itself is highly sensitive to radiation, but draws in a huge variety of minerals and nutrients from the soil, including uranium. It pumps excess nutrients into bulbous protrusions on its roots, and uses them to seal off the uranium. These capsules contain the radiation so completely that they may be safely handled without the need for even token protective gear. While tricky to cultivate, it is completely safe, and may even be planted near edibles.</description>
