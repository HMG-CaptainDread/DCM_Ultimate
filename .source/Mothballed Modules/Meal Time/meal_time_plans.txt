basic plans
	- add a whole bunch of meals, recipes and snacks
	- add some new ways to make the meals (stoves for cooking, ovens for baking, etc.)
	- integrate all the vanilla expanded stuff in a better way
	- add some furniture designs to work with hospitality or just broadly make proper canteen locations
	- add some tools to aid in cooking in various ways
