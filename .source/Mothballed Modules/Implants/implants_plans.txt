basic plans
	- make a whole bunch of new implants to slim down the need to run about 12 different implant mods
	- integrate mods that add implants alongside other things so things play nicely with each other (void)
	- "hot-swappable" implants on extremities so that the surgery to replace implants are a one time thing with the ability to "hot-swap" arms, legs, etc.
