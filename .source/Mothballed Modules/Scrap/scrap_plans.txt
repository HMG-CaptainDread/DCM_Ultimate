basic plans
	- this module will allow for the "harvesting" of scrap from deconstructing ruined shit around the world, mainly because it annoyed me that we're told there's "nothing useful" despite being literally tons of scrap metal
	- refining the scrap or sorting it will work in much the same way that vanilla recycling does stuff but a wee bit more in depth
	- will also likely change a shit ton of the recycling in VRE that will result in this being my personal preferred mod to use over it, unsorted trash becomes the default instead of wastepacks
