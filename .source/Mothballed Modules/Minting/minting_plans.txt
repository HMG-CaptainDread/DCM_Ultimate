until i find someone who can do c# who can assist with extending the currency class in base game rimworld, this module will remain deader than disco

basic layout of the plans:
	each faction "tier" uses a different level of currency
	the player faction can mint, print, find or trade for the currency in order to trade with these factions
	currencies range from shells/wampum-esque with tribal factions to "credits" at the higher levels
