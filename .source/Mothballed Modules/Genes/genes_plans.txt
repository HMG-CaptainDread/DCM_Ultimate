until a c# developer is found, a large portion of this module won't see the light of day

the basic plans are completely possible to do via xml, however, the advanced plans are as follows:

	- adding a small "genes" option to both animals and plants in the same way as dimonsever000.insectgenes does it but with the ability to make new "genelines"
	- adding a fully interactive/changeable gene editing doodad that allows for splicing genes for the plants
	- adding a framework that will allow others to create their own genes to interact with the base code
