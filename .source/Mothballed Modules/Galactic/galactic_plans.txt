due to odyssey's recent release it's uncertain how much of the plans will require c# and how much can be handled by xml only additions

basic plans
	- add some new asteroids based on the new metals added by metallurgy
	- add some new materials only available with space exploration
	- see if the moon code leftover even works and if so, make moons configurable
	- add some new shuttle types
	- maybe see if its possible to add an upgrade menu to the shuttles a la vehicles expanded upgrades
