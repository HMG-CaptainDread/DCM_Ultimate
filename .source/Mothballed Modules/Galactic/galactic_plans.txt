due to odyssey's recent release it's uncertain how much of the plans will require c# and how much can be handled by xml only additions

basic plans
	- add some new asteroids based on the new metals added by metallurgy
	- add some new materials only available with space exploration
	- see if the moon code leftover even works and if so, make moons configurable
	- add some new shuttle types
	- maybe see if its possible to add an upgrade menu to the shuttles a la vehicles expanded upgrades
	- add new ship parts for different ways to power the gravships, nuclear and the new fuels in production module
	- add new space station parts and allow for the texturing the same way as the ship hulls in order to make a nice curvy based
	- see about improving the launch to orbit mod's code in order to have an area the same size as the standard map
	- add some new ship parts for cosmetics and general "base-ifying" the gravship, research benches, solar panels, resource collection, etc.
	- add some new gravsuits and implement the EVA mod spacewalking, including a vacuum proof something for babies, maybe baby clothing? definitely cribs
	- add some new furniture that has the ability to over/underlap and fold up/down
	- add a new system of pipes for ventilation, will clear vacuum and gases
	- add a new selection of roofs that will allow for shuttle movement and blocking drop pod raids
	- add a bunch of orbital weathers and events, with variable consequences dependant on the layer of orbit, the further out, the worse they'll be
	- add some stellaris type behemoths in far far orbit, maybe a "discoverable" location or quest to find and hunt the behemoths, killing them gives you something unique? we'll see
