    <label>Mechanitor Ship</label>
    <description>Mechanitor ship, recreated using ancient technology, has worse fuel consumption, slightly better recharge time before departure, and greater flight range, though it falls short of the Drone. The main advantage is high cargo capacity and a larger fuel tank. Requires a mechanitor colonist to research.</description>
