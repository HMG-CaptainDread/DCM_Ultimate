    <description>The three of you awoke in your cots to the sound of gunfire and shrapnel. The enemy is upon you, debris is falling from your crowded and rapidly deteriorating bunker. You barely make it outside before the entire bunker collapses from the impact of the artillery fire. The three of you keep running farther from the battlefield, carrying nothing but what you had in your packs. The base is lost to the enemy, and you are lost in the wilderness beyond it.\n\nNote: Since you'll start poor and without materials, this is a difficult scenario.</description>
