so, rimworld has 6 "ages", each one of these is determined by DCM using the following rule:

	1 - Neolithic	- neolithic is essentially all things that would be made by tribals, very few, if any, metal/smithing recipes are present
	2 - Medieval	- medieval is all the things that came about using metal and smithing, plate armour, swords, crossbows, early guns, etc.
	3 - Industrial	- industrial is all the things that would fit in from the industrial revolutionary era all the way up until space travel
	4 - Spacer		- spacer is all the things that would fit in from about 1950 until anything considered "ultratech"
	5 - Ultra		- ultra is all the things that seem "achievable" but out of reach, light sci-fi type of things, think lasers and power armours
	6 - Archotech	- archotech is for everything complete out of reach, harnessing black holes, quasar technology, etc.
